Please remember that copying and pasting mappings from alternate projects under more restrictive licenses (such as MCP or Mojang's obfuscation maps)
is **completely forbidden** without explicit permission from the owners of said mappings to distribute the names under the CC0 license.
This includes using the names from those mappings for inspiration. Discussing the naming approaches used in said projects
is also not welcome - you have been warned. However, it is a good idea to consult name changes with other people - use pull requests or our community spaces to ask questions!

Please have a look at the [naming conventions](/CONVENTIONS.md) before submitting mappings.
